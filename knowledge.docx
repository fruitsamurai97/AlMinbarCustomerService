Arabic courses
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)
Also called Fusha, essential for anyone interested in studying, living, and working in the Middle East and North Africa.
Modern Arabic is the official language of all 26  Arab countries and one of the six official languages of U.N. Learning Arabic is essential for those who are willing to live in an Arab country or work in a field in a relation with the Arab world.This student centered course aims to develop all areas of the language: speaking, listening, reading and writing and the educational support used by our teachers is Al-Kitaab fii Ta’allum al-‘Arabiyya.
Classical Arabic
Also called Quranic Arabic, is mainly for people interested in classical Arabic literature and the Noble Quran. Learners who want to understand old literature and Quran should learn Classical Arabic instead of MSA.
Colloquial Moroccan Arabic (CMA)
Also called Darija, is the vernacular language in Morocco, people use it to communicate in their daily life.
Despite not having the status of an official language, Darija is more and more used even in media. It has a deep resemblance with Arabic, however due to the geographic position of Morocco, history and movement of people, Darija has strong influences from Berber, French, Spanish and other European languages.
We recommend students who intend to stay in Morocco for a long period of time learn it if they want to integrate into society and immerse themselves in the Moroccan culture.
Arab Islamic history and civilization
We also give lectures and private lessons on the history of Islam, Arab Muslim civilization, media Arabic, Quranic Arabic, Arabic Literature, business Arabic, Islamic law (Sharia) and diplomatic Arabic.

Levels & certificates

Beginner (divided into 3 sub-levels: Low, medium, and high);
Intermediate (divided into 3 sub-levels: Low, medium, and high);
Advanced (divided into 3 sub-levels: Low, medium, and high);
After filling the registration form, we will set you for a test to see which level you fit in: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced, and what sublevel is more suitable: low, medium or high.
Whenever students finish a sublevel, we set them for a test to see if they have acquired all the necessary skills to pass to the next sublevel, and each time they pass an exam, we give them a certificate for the level achieved.
Students’ venue & accomodations
Our students have many options for housing for their study period at Al-Minbar.

Host family
New for some students, this housing method had and is still proving its effectiveness when it comes to quick integration. A deep understanding of both Moroccan culture and traditions is a great way to better assimilate the Arabic language. Students find themselves naturally trying to use as many Arabic words as they could to be understood, especially when the host family aren’t fluent in English.
What is necessary however is to live with a family with a solid experience in hosting foreigners and providing them with safety, warmth, and unique social interactions.
The good news is that we follow one of the tidiest selection criteria among other institutes. Host family accommodation includes breakfast and dinner every day.
Students residence
Another accommodation we offer is student residence.
The residence is almost adjacent to the school, close to restaurants, coffee shops, the old medina, and transportation. Students can choose a single or double room.
Studio apartment
The other option we offer our students is Studio Apartment. This type of accommodation offers more freedom, it is the best option for students who want to stay for the long term.
The studio apartments are located in downtown close to the school as well as the restaurants, shops, transportation.
Academic calendar
When you choose Al Minbar Institute you also choose customized services and flexible policy. The covid-19 period certainly taught us all a lot as individuals but also as organizations.
On the other hand, our large variety of Arabic courses programs respond to almost any need.
Customized group size, personalized classes frequency or classes length are all parameters that every group of students, university or organization could benefit from.
Our individual, semester, semi-intensive and intensive Arabic courses starting dates for the current year, are as bellow:
(*) Date suitable for complete beginners who never studied Arabic before.
(A) Academic Semester program start date.
(*) All our packages are customizable

Cultural immersive activities
Every aspect of our program is carefully studied allowing students to live the best experience while learning Arabic.
Al-Minbar includes in its program, many activities that help students immerse themselves in their learning experience. These activities include trips, cooking, calligraphy, local excursions, internships, and volunteering.

Cooking 
The influence of Morocco’s geographical position can be seen in the diversity and richness of Moroccan gastronomy known worldwide for its good flavors and test.
We offer our students an opportunity to improve their skills in the Arabic language while participating in cooking workshops animated by independent cooks who could be a member of a host family, a hired cook, or an Al-Minbar’s employee, we all cook a lot in Morocco.
Music 
As for food, music in Morocco is extremely diverse. Chaabi, Gnawa, Reggada, Ahwach, Tarab Andaloussi or Al Aata are all radically different music types even though they co-exist in the same area, these music genres have different roots:
African for Gnawa, Berbere for Ahwah or Spanish for Tarab Andaloussi. Students who play an instrument, learning to play one or simply are eager to discover new music are delighted when listening for the first time of their life to Al Ganbri or Krikbat.
Calligpahy 
It is no secret that the Arabic language is different from the Latin languages. The letters are not the same, the rules can sometimes be misleading and phonetics is always a challenge to non-natives, but one appreciated thing is certainly the Arabic Calligraphy. That is why we carry out this activity to get to know more about this beautiful artistic handwriting of Arabic.

Internships & volunteering

This is for learners who are interested in making a difference, looking for new skills acquisitions, and building connections and friendships with others. They will be placed in an area that reflects their interests, previous work experience, and educational background, subject to the availability of positions and pending acceptance from the organization of the association.
Upon successful completion of the internship or volunteering, learners will receive a certificate of completion and a personal reference from us.
*Most of the activities take place every week.
Weekends trips 
We believe that one of the excellent ways to discover and explore a country is through traveling, especially when you take road trips. Therefore, we organize trips and offer them to students who are interested.
The trips also help students discover a new regional culture and Arabic accents during the journeys hence strengthening their Arabic skills naturally.
Local excursions
Al-Minbar organizes weekly local visits to different historical and cultural places in Rabat and surrounding areas, like Kasbah Oudaya, Museums, Chellah, Hassan Tour … . We believe this is an effective way for our students to learn and practice Arabic as well as improve their communication skills and connect with the locals.
